# CareBoo.AlgoSdk.WebSocket

Cloned and modified from [Unity's multiplayer-community-contributions repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions).

## Modifications:

- Removed the files that rely on the Netcode for GameObjects package.
- Generated new .meta files to prevent errors on .unitypackage import.
- Changed the namespace to `AlgoSdk.WebSocket` to avoid confusion when used in conjunction with Netcode transports.
